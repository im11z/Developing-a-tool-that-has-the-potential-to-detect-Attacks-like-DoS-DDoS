# Developing-a-tool-that-has-the-potential-to-detect-Attacks-like-DoS-DDoS called ShieldGuard
ShieldGuard is a real-time DoS and DDoS detection tool built using Python, Scapy, and Flask. 
It captures live network traffic, analyzes packet behavior, identifies abnormal traffic spikes,
and classifies attack conditions. The system displays live status, traffic statistics, and attacker 
information through a web-based dashboard. Automatic mitigation is performed using firewall rules 
to block suspicious IPs. Includes PoC screenshots, attack simulation using hping3, and a clear 
technical stack.
